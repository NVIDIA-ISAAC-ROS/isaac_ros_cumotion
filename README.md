## Overview

Isaac ROS cuMotion provides CUDA-accelerated manipulation
capabilities for robots in ROS 2.  It provides two main capabilities:

1. Motion generation for robot arms via integration of [cuMotion](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/concepts/manipulation/index.html#concept-cumotion)
   into MoveIt 2
2. Segmentation of robots from depth streams using cuMotion’s kinematics and geometry
   processing functions to accurately identify and filter out parts of the robot.
   This allows reconstruction of obstacles in the environment without spurious contributions
   from the robot itself.

The key advantages of using Isaac ROS cuMotion are:

* **Improved cycle times:** cuMotion produces smooth, optimal-time trajectories in the
  presence of obstacles, generally reducing motion times compared to previous
  state-of-the-art planners.  In cluttered environments and other challenging scenarios,
  cuMotion can often produce a valid trajectory when other planners might fail altogether.
* **Improved planning times:** cuMotion takes advantage of CUDA acceleration to produce
  collision-free, optimal-time trajectories in a fraction of a second.
* **Avoidance of obstacles captured by depth cameras:** cuMotion optionally leverages
  [nvblox](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/repositories_and_packages/isaac_ros_nvblox/index.html) to perform 3D reconstruction of an environment from one or more depth image
  streams.  The environment is represented as a signed distance field (SDF) for
  efficient obstacle-aware planning.  Support is provided for segmenting and filtering
  the robot itself from the depth streams.
* **Flexibility:** A modular design simplifies integration with existing ROS 2 workflows,
  especially those already using MoveIt 2.

> [!Warning]
> Before using or developing with cuMotion or other Isaac for Manipulation software, please read and
> familiarize yourself with the associated safety information that is provided by your robot
> manufacturer.

> In addition, we provide the following best practices:

> 1. Familiarize yourself with the location of the emergency stop buttons, and be prepared to apply if necessary.
> 2. Before operation, ensure the working area is free of any persons or other potential hazards.
> 3. Before operation, alert all persons near the working area that robot operation is about to begin.
> 4. Before and during operation, be aware of any persons entering the vicinity around the working area,
>    and be prepared to give necessary warnings, instructions, or take other necessary actions.
> 5. Take extra caution when testing or deploying new features or code.

Examples are provided for three modes of operation:

* **Standalone MoveIt:** MoveIt’s RViz interface allows trajectories to be planned and visualized even without a physical
  robot or external simulator.
* **Simulated robot (Isaac Sim):** Trajectories may be planned and executed on a simulated robot in
  [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim), allowing convenient development and rapid iteration without
  use of physical hardware.  Simulated sensors enable testing of perception, e.g., for the purpose of collision avoidance.
* **Physical robot:** For on-robot testing and final deployment, trajectories are planned and executed on a physical
  robot.

The Isaac ROS cuMotion repository currently contains the following packages:

`isaac_ros_cumotion`:
: This package contains the cuMotion planner node and the robot segmentation node.

`isaac_ros_cumotion_examples`:
: This package contains various examples demonstrating use of cuMotion with MoveIt.

`isaac_ros_cumotion_moveit`:
: This package provides a plugin for MoveIt 2 that exposes cuMotion as an external planner, leveraging `isaac_ros_cumotion`.

Isaac ROS cuMotion is also featured as part of [Isaac for Manipulation](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/reference_workflows/isaac_for_manipulation/index.html).
